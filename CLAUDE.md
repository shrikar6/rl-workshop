Welcome to my codebase! This is my RL workshop, where I come to experiment with reinforcement learning algorithms and architectures for whatever environments I am in the mood to solve.

Here are some things you need to know:
- The overarching goal of this workshop is to create a personal workshop that minimizes the time it takes for me to create an experiment, while still maintaining full flexibility to try out new ideas.
- Thus, the codebase is designed with maximal modularity and "plug-and-playability" in mind - in my main experiments' code, I want to be able to quickly swap out agents, network architectures, and basically any other component with minimal friction. It is your goal to also optimize for maximal modularity, reusability, and "plug-and-playability" in this way. This is priority 1 and should not be sacrificed for anything.
- The next priority is JAX idiomaticity. I want to leverage JAX's strengths (functional programming, JIT compilation, etc.) as much as possible, and avoid anti-patterns that would make the code less efficient or less elegant. Your goal is to also optimize for this priority (priority 2) and should not be sacrificed for anything other than priority 1.
- The next priority is excellent software engineering practices in the way we write and structure the code. Your goal is to also optimize for this priority (priority 3) and should not be sacrificed for anything other than priorities 1 and 2 (there's a caveat to this though, as explained in the next line)
- Our final priority is elegance and minimalism. This means writing code that is as simple and concise as possible, without sacrificing clarity or functionality. This means writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Your goal is to also optimize for this priority (priority 4) and should not be sacrificed for anything other than priorities 1, 2, and 3. There will be moments though where priority 3 and 4 are in direct conflict (use your judgement here to determine when this is) with each other, and in these scenarios we want to prioritize priority 4 over priority 3.

Other things you should keep in mind:
- I expect your communication style to be verbose! Verbosity will help me learn and understand better, and will also help with long-term health and maintainability of the codebase. This is because detailed explanations will help me learn. It will also help me identify your reasoning for doing things at every step, which will help me both in identifying when something we're doing is out of the scope of my understanding (and I can thus ask you questions about it), and if something potentially looks wrong to me (which I will also ask you about and we can discuss and clarify together).
- We want to keep a YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) mindset, avoiding premature optimization or over-engineering.
- Elegance is key. We should strive for it always.
- I am the only one who uses this codebase. So backwards-incompatible changes for the sake of improvement are acceptable.
- I am not a perfect programmer. I make mistakes and have blind spots. Please regularly read the codebase from a bird's eye view and point out any improvements that you notice can be made. Specifically: flag issues you notice in files you're already reading/editing during our work, but save comprehensive codebase reviews for when explicitly asked or at natural stopping points.
- I am extremely new to all the concepts that underpin machine learning, reinforcement learning, and JAX. I appreciate clear explanations and patience at each step.
- Since I'm still new to all this, I require you to be as thoughtful and accurate with your code generation as possible. I don't know what's right and what's wrong, so I'm heavily reliant on your expertise, and thus require that you double-check to verify your work at every step. I will constantly push back and ask for clarifications at every step, this is not me telling me that you're wrong and should flip your answer, but me ensuring that we arrive at the correct solution together. I only care that you strive for accuracy in all things, and if that means you sometimes telling me that my suggestions are garbage, that's perfectly acceptable to me!
